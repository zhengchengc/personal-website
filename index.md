# About me

I'm a senior software engineer with 3 years of experience in developing and maintaining Java applications. I'm currently based in Melbourne, Australia, where I work for a leading legal tech company that provides innovative solutions for lawyers and clients.

Some of my skills and achievements include:

- Designing and implementing scalable and secure web services using Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, and AWS
- Leading a team of 4 developers in delivering a complex project on time and within budget
- Improving the performance and reliability of the existing codebase by applying best practices and code reviews
- Contributing to the open source community by sharing my knowledge and code on GitHub and Stack Overflow
- Learning new technologies and frameworks to keep up with the latest trends and challenges in the software industry

I'm passionate about creating high-quality software that solves real-world problems and adds value to the users. I'm always eager to learn new things and improve my skills. I'm also a friendly and collaborative person who enjoys working with others and sharing ideas.
